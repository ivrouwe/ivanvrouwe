		<p>Web accessibility opens up the internet to people who may otherwise have been unable to use it. Websites are ubiquitous, but many of them cannot be fully (or correctly) accessed by people with temporary, situational, or permanent disabilities. All of us, regardless of age, have the potential to experience a disability in our lifetime. I can help you to open up your website to a wider audience and improve your users' experiences.</p>
